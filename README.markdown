## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This minimalistic, subdued design was preferred by the users, allowing for some calm during a strenuous work day.  Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I was able to create all the functionality while learning even more in-depth knowledge of our business flow.


## Optimizations:

I would build out a full backend API using Node, Express, and MongoDB as the database.  Then I would add authentication so we could track what technician entered a certain pallet.  A feature could be added to filter by the user and/or date of entry.

## Lessons Learned:

This application allowed my team of technicians to enter their data from the pallets that were in the quality hold areas and then automatically send an email to the appropriate parties for things like SAP transactions and quantity corrections, which would then be updated in our enterprise resource planning software.  The application allows users to verify if they have the correct piece count and case range and then copy that info into other spreadsheets that were used by our department and management.
